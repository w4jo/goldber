# Code Quality Guidelines

- Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.
- Make changes file by file and give me a chance to spot mistakes.
- Never use apologies.
- Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.
- Don't suggest whitespace changes.
- Don't summarize changes made.
- Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.
- Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.
- Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.
- Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file.
- Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.
- Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.
- Always provide links to the real files, not x.md.
- Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.

## Code Style and Structure
- Project files are in src folder.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.

## Constants Over Magic Numbers
- Replace hard-coded values with named constants
- Use descriptive constant names that explain the value's purpose
- Keep constants at the top of the file or in a dedicated constants file

## Meaningful Names
- Variables, functions, and classes should reveal their purpose
- Names should explain why something exists and how it's used
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're universally understood

## Smart Comments
- Don't comment on what the code does - make the code self-documenting
- Use comments to explain why something is done a certain way
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects

## Single Responsibility
- Each function should do exactly one thing
- Functions should be small and focused
- If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, it should be split

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated code into reusable functions
- Share common logic through proper abstraction
- Maintain single sources of truth

## Clean Structure
- Keep related code together
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions

## Encapsulation
- Hide implementation details
- Expose clear interfaces
- Move nested conditionals into well-named functions

## Code Quality Maintenance
- Refactor continuously
- Fix technical debt early
- Leave code cleaner than you found it
